Future Plans

While MechLocator is already a powerful and valuable tool for finding reliable mechanics, I have big plans for the future. 
My goal is to continuously improve the site and add new features that will make it even more useful for users and mechanics.

In the near future, I plan to add a feature that allows users to book appointments with mechanics directly through the site. 
This feature will save users time and effort, and it will also help mechanics to manage their schedule more efficiently.

I also plan to add more detailed information about each mechanic, such as their certifications, specializations, and service offerings. 
This will help users to find mechanics that are best suited for their needs.

Additionally, I are also exploring the use of machine learning to improve the search results, 
this will help users to find the best mechanic for their needs. I are also looking into integrating more APIs and third-party services 
to provide more information to my users and mechanics.
